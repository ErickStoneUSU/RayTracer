The process:
We scan across the film.
- We get the location of the depth of the object at each point on the film.
- We create a ray from the left eye to the object depth location.
- We create a ray from the right eye to the object depth location.
- We find the intersection of the ray and the film.
- The total jump distance is the left film intersect to the right film intersect distance.
- We set the right pixel in the random map to the value of the left pixel in the random map.
- (The film maps to the random map)
- Starting at either the left or the right pixel we jump left and right assigning all random map pixels we touch to the same color.
- One more thing, the value we set the random map to is offset by one pixel to the left as this will give the illusion of depth.

That is it, once every pixel in the depth map has been hit, the random map is populated with a stereogram.

The ray from the eye to the depth map image can be found by using the fact that the eye to the i location to the depth map location makes a right triangle.
Then we can build a smaller right triangle with the same angles from the film i location to the depth map location to the new pixel location.
We can find the new pixel location using a ratio of side/ side  = side / side;

The math:
(eyeRight - i) / (255-depth + eyeToFilm + filmToDepthMap)  == (x-i)/(255-depth + filmToDepthMap);
(i - eyeLeft) / (255-depth + eyeToFilm + filmToDepthMap)  == (x-i)/(255-depth + filmToDepthMap); 
-->
-->
float filmRightDist = (righteye - i) * (eyeNormToPlane - m) / (eyeNormToPlane - m + 255) + i;
float filmLeftDist = (i - lefteye) * (eyeNormToPlane - m) / (eyeNormToPlane - m + 255) + i;
